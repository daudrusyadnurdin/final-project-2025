# Final Project 2025: Obesity Level Prediction
Here are all files of my final project at DA/DS bootcamp class batch 34 at [dibimbing.id](https://dibimbing.id/).
Please click, here is [my streamlit work](https://final-project-2025-obesity-level-prediction.streamlit.app/), has been deployed on streamlit cloud.

If you have any questions (about streamlit), checkout the following addresses: [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).<br><br>

## NOTES:
Below are my notes when developing application at streamlit.
- During the development phase, open Codespaces, create a Python program in **streamlit_app.py**, and then run it. If there are any errors, identify them and how to fix them, until there are no errors.

- If it runs successfully (no errors), run this command below at Terminal. Copy and paste it, then press Enter. Wait a few minutes until the process finished, then a message will appear at the bottom right of the screen [run in Browser] --> select the button and it will go to the browser we are aiming for.

  **$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection false**

- Before deploying your job, it's a good idea to give it a meaningful name in **streamlit.io**. For example, in this task, I named it **[final-project-2025-obesity-level-prediction.streamlit.app](https://final-project-2025-obesity-level-prediction.streamlit.app/)**. **streamlit.app** is the default streamlit name.

- To deploy streamlit's work, create a **runtime.txt** in the root of the github repository and fill it with **python-3.11** or another stable version.

- Don't forget to include all the libraries imported in the Python program that we created in the **requirements.txt** file.
