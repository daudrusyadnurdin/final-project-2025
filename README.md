# final-project-2025
My Data Science final project at dibimbing.id.

This repository is used to store all work (documents, coding, etc.) related to the final data science bootcamp project at dibimbing.id for the DA/DS bootcamp batch 34 class.

Assignment Day 40, at bootcamp DS/DA batch 34 [dibimbing.id](https://dibimbing.id/)

Here is [my streamlit work](https://telco-customer-churn-analysis-2025.streamlit.app/). Please click here.

If you have any questions (about streamlit), checkout the following addresses: [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).<br><br>


## NOTES:
- During the development phase, open Codespaces, create a Python program in **streamlit_app.py**, and then run it. If there are any errors, identify them and how to fix them, until there are no errors.

- If it runs successfully (no errors), run this command below at Terminal. Copy and paste it, then press Enter. Wait a few minutes until the process finished, then a message will appear at the bottom right of the screen [run in Browser] --> select the button and it will go to the browser we are aiming for.

  **$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.enableCORS false --server.enableXsrfProtection false**

- Before deploying your job, it's a good idea to give it a meaningful name in **streamlit.io**. For example, in this task, I named it **telco-customer-churn-analysis-2025.streamlit.app**. **streamlit.app** is the default streamlit name.

- To deploy streamlit's work, create a **runtime.txt** in the root of the github repository and fill it with **python-3.11** or another stable version.

- Don't forget to include all the libraries imported in the Python program that we created in the **requirements.txt** file.
