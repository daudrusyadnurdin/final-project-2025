# Final Project 2025: Obesity Levels Prediction
Here are all files of my final project at DA/DS bootcamp class batch 34 at [dibimbing.id](https://dibimbing.id/).
Please click, here is [my streamlit data science final project work](https://final-project-2025-obesity-level-prediction.streamlit.app/), has been deployed on streamlit cloud.

## NOTES:
✅ This application was developed as part of the final project requirement for the DA/DS Bootcamp 34 at Dibimbing.id.<br>
✅ The app is built using the Streamlit framework, making it easy to implement. Several informational sections and dashboards are included for completeness; however, **the main function of this application is to predict the level of obesity based on user-provided input parameters.**<br>
✅ The implemented machine learning model is **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting), selected as the best-performing model with the highest prediction accuracy among all trained, tested, and evaluated candidates, while also offering high processing speed.
